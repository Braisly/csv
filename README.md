Objective: In this Java project, the goal is to convert text files into csv files.

IDE: Netbeans 7.2.

Description: The project is a simple Java source code with the capabilities to transform some text files into csv files. 
			 First point, the tex files are composed with 4 parameters but in the name of each file, there is the date. 
			 Second point, the new files will have the previous parameters and the date, year and month. Also each parameter will divide with a comma.
			 Finally the project have some loops to run multiple files. The reason that I created this project is that I want to analyse the ocean temperatures from NOAA.
